# Title 
 MET CS 701 Term Project - Nick Koutsoulidakis
 
## Description
 This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.6. It is a weather app that displays 
the weather forecast for a given location in either current, hourly or daily format. Each format is a different page.

## Usage
 1) Start the server and open the browser using the port used. If using VSCode, at the root folder, the command on 
    the terminal line is: ng serve --port [port number] / ex --> ng serve --port 4200 
 2) Geo Location may prompt for permission when first running the app. Grant the requested permission then hit refresh.
 3) At the initial startup, the location will be blank. There is functionality coded into the app to determine the user's location based on Geo Location
    coordinates when there is no location in local storage (previously chosen location). 
 4) The Current forecast page launches at startup. Simply change the location by typing it in then hitting <enter>.
 5) The forecast can be displayed in either Fahrenheit or Celsius. These can be toggled by clicking the appropriate radio buttons
  under the location edit box. The default setting is Fahrenheit.
 6) The Hourly forecast page can be selected by clicking the 'Hourly' link.
 7) The Daily forecast page can be selected by clicking the 'Daily' link.
 8) In the event a location is added that cannot be verified to exist, the links will be disabled and a message will display on the Current page 
    indicating this status.
